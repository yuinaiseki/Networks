This final group project is for CSC324: Software Design and Development taught at Grinnell College
in Fall 2024 by Dr. Fernanda Eliott. For this project, hypothetically we are a non-profit organization
examining the effects of lack of commitment and its impact on cascading failures within real-world
social and economic network systems. Specifically, we will investigate how defection and cooperation 
behaviors in a networked Prisoner’s Dilemma Game (PDG) influence cascading failure behavior, po-
tentially leading to large-scale network collapse. We observe this effect by changing the α value (the
threshold to remove an agent from a network) and the β value (the incentive to defect) and analyzing
its effects. By replicating a recent study by Wang et al., we aim to verify its findings and assess if
defection strategies, while beneficial in the short term, contribute to system-wide vulnerabilities and
lead to a cascading network failure.
