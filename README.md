This final group project is for CSC324: Software Design and Development taught at Grinnell College
in Fall 2024 by Dr. Fernanda Eliott. For this project, hypothetically we are a non-profit organization
examining the effects of lack of commitment and its impact on cascading failures within real-world
social and economic network systems. 

Specifically, we will investigate how defection and cooperation behaviors in a networked Prisoner’s Dilemma Game (PDG)
influence cascading failure behavior, potentially leading to large-scale network collapse. 
We observe this effect by changing the α value (the threshold to remove an agent from a network) and 
the β value (the incentive to defect) and analyzing its effects. By replicating a recent study by Wang et al.,
we show that short-term defection strategies can destabilize large networked systems, resulting in cascading failures. 
Moreover, we demonstrate that a cooperative approach provides resilience against such failures, 
ensuring long-term network stability and reducing the risk of total system collapse.
